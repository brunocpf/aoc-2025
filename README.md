# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025 programming challenges](https://adventofcode.com/2025). There will be 12 challenges this year, one released each day from December 1st to December 12th.

I'll be attempting to solve each day's challenge in multiple programming languages for fun and practice. I'll try to start with languages I don't use as often as an extra challenge.

I'll also be disabling AI tools/copilot-style completions.

## Challenges

- Day 1: Dart - [Solution](/day01/README.md)
- Day 2: Elixir - [Solution](/day02/README.md)
- Day 3: Scala = [Solution](/day03/README.md)
- Day 4: WIP
- Day 5: WIP
- Day 6: WIP
- Day 7: WIP
- Day 8: WIP
- Day 9: WIP
- Day 10: WIP
- Day 11: WIP
- Day 12: WIP

## How to Run

Each day's challenge is contained in its own directory (e.g., `day01`, `day02`, etc.). Inside each directory, you'll find the solution code and instructions on how to run it in the respective language.

This repo is configured with Dev Containers for easy setup in each language. If you have Docker and VSCode installed, you can open the project in a Dev Container for the specific day to get started quickly.
